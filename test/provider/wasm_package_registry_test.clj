(ns provider.wasm-package-registry-test
  "Every row of wasm-packages-v1.edn, not the eight the other suites name.

  The registry is what `verify-wasm-package-digest`, `grant-binding` and
  `production-claim-blockers` read: a row's `:sha256` is the content address a
  grant is bound to. Before this namespace only the 8 pure-allowlist rows were
  checked against their bytes (`kit-package-test/pure-allowlist-real-wasm`);
  the other 134 -- including all 112 compiler-AOT rows -- could claim a digest
  no test compared to anything.

  What this does NOT check: that the shipped `.wasm` is what the declared
  `:source-kotoba` compiles to. That needs the compiler and a recorded builder
  commit, and the registry records neither -- `:builder :kotoba-compiler/v1`
  names a tool, not a version. Measured 2026-08-12 against the fleet's compiler
  pin 806f5ce: of the 71 `:wasm-module` rows with a declared source, 35
  reproduce byte-identically, 29 differ, and 7 no longer compile. So the
  source-to-artifact direction stays unguarded here on purpose rather than by
  omission."
