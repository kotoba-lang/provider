  "Bounded canonical value wire for provider ops-kit audit events.

  Three ways bytes reach this boundary, in descending order of what the host
  decides:

  - `guest-hex->audit-bytes` (ADR 0285) — the GUEST decided the bytes and the
    host only un-hexes and admits them. `:secret-value-wire` is the first
    package on this path.
  - `encode-audit-value` — the host encodes a domain value it already holds.
  - `legacy-edn->audit-bytes` (ADR 0284) — the bounded compatibility bridge for
    W4 packages that still export EDN text: the host parses that closed EDN
    value and re-encodes it canonically. Every kit except secret is still here."
