(defn- valid-tick?
  "A tick is valid when it is a non-negative whole number in the host's own
  canonical i64 representation. This is `(and (integer? tick) (<= 0
  tick))` on `:clj`, where a `System/currentTimeMillis`/`System/nanoTime`-
  derived `long` already satisfies `integer?` directly. On `:cljs`, a
  plain cljs number is NOT the canonical i64 representation the ABI
  boundary (`kotoba.kir.value`/`kotoba.kir.cljs-i64`) requires
  for a `typed-cap-call` result crossing back into a compiled `.kotoba`
  guest -- only a JS `bigint` is (`cljs.core/integer?` itself does not
  reliably recognize `bigint`, confirmed live: `(integer? (js/BigInt 5))`
  => false; see `cljs-i64.cljs`'s own ns docstring for the same warning).
  So the `:cljs` branch checks `i64/bigint-value?` (the canonical i64
  predicate every other cljs-side provider in this ADR chain also uses)
  instead of `integer?`, and `(not (i64/k-neg? tick))` instead of `(<= 0
  tick)` (mixing a bigint with a plain-number `0` in `<=` happens to work
  today, but `k-neg?`/the bigint-literal `zero` is the pattern this
  namespace's own sibling `cljs-i64` helpers standardize on). This is the
  SAME non-negative-whole-number requirement on both hosts -- neither
  branch admits anything `valid-tick?` on the other host would reject --
  only the host-native representation of 'whole number' differs."

  above branches by host: this counter is itself an `:i64`-typed field
  (`wall-type`/`monotonic-type`'s `:observation-sequence`), so on `:cljs`
  a plain-number `inc` would produce a value the ABI boundary rejects at
  the exact same `typed-cap-call` result check `valid-tick?`'s own
  docstring describes, regardless of what a host's `wall-now`/
  `monotonic-now` returns. `i64/one` is a `bigint`; JS's native `+`
  operator (which cljs's own `+` compiles down to for two bigint operands)
  adds two bigints exactly, so this is a lossless, unbounded-precision
  increment on `:cljs`, matching plain `inc` on a `:clj` `long` closely
  enough for this counter's practical range."
