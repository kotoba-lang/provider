(ns provider.stream-ingress
  "Bidirectional frame-stream reference provider (root ADR-2608150900).

  `provider.http-ingress` is one request paired to one reply. A telephone call's
  media, a websocket, a pipe are none of those: frames arrive continuously and
  leave continuously, unpaired, and what ends a turn is silence rather than a
  response.

  Host owns the listen. The guest never receives a socket:

  - host opens a stream with `open!` and injects frames with `deliver!`
  - guest polls with `:stream/accept` (option of opened | frame | closed)
  - guest speaks with `:stream/send`

  ## Two capabilities, because they are two authorities

  A guest allowed to HEAR a stream has not thereby been allowed to SPEAK into
  it. A single `:stream/transact` would have made a listening receptionist and a
  talking one the same grant.

  ## Overflow closes the stream; it never drops a frame

  A dropped audio frame is a glitch that looks like nothing happened — inaudible
  to the program, audible only to the person on the other end. When the queue is
  full the stream is CLOSED with `:queue-overflow`, which is a fact the guest can
  act on. The sequence number exists for the same reason: a gap is how a guest
  learns frames were lost, and without it a lossy stream and a quiet one are the
  same observation.

  ## Payloads are text

  Binary transports base64 their frames and the guest decodes them. That decode
  has to be writable in the language for this provider to be usable rather than
  merely declared, which is what the `:base64-kit` conformance case establishes."
