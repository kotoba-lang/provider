(ns provider.http-transport
  "Production transport for the bounded HTTP capability kit (ADR 0026,
  `provider.http`), backed by a real blocking
  `java.net.http.HttpClient`. See
  docs/adr/0066-production-http-transport-bounded-redirect-following.md for
  the full design rationale; this docstring is the summary.

  This namespace does NOT define a new provider or a new capability, and does
  NOT modify `http.cljc`. Every bound `http.cljc` already enforces on the
  guest-facing request -- exact-origin allowlist, absolute-HTTPS-only, no
  fragments, header-count/size/body/timeout bounds -- runs exactly as before,
  unchanged and un-weakened, before this transport is ever invoked. This
  namespace builds the one thing every provider in this ADR chain has always
  deferred to the host (ADR 0026: 'Production hosts may implement deadlines
  and I/O outside the guest, but must return the same bounded result'): a
  real synchronous `(fn [request] -> reply)` you pass as `:transport` to
  `provider.http/provider`.

  ## SSRF is the primary threat model here, not an afterthought

  ADR 0064's LLM transport always calls ONE fixed, host-chosen endpoint.
  `:http/post` calls whatever HTTPS origin the GUEST names, bounded only by
  the host's own closed `allowed-origins` set -- so, unlike the LLM
  transport, this is a genuine server-side-request-forgery surface. Three
  defenses this namespace adds ON TOP OF (never in place of) `http.cljc`'s
  own bounds:

  1. **Redirects are never auto-followed by the JDK.** The `HttpClient` is
     built with `HttpClient$Redirect/NEVER`; THIS namespace owns the redirect
     loop instead, and re-validates EVERY hop's resolved origin against the
     exact same closed `allowed-origins` set the host also gave to
     `http/provider` (a required constructor option here, not optional, and
     it must be the identical set) before following it -- matching the
     capability kit's own already-declared semantics
     (`resources/kotoba/lang/capability-kits/http-v1.edn`:
     `:redirects :transport-must-not-follow-outside-allowlist`). A redirect
     whose target origin is not in the allow-list, or that would exceed
     `:max-redirects` (default 5), is simply NOT followed -- the 3xx
     response is returned to the guest as an ordinary typed `:ok` response
     (never silently swallowed, never a thrown exception) so the guest or
     its host can decide whether to issue a fresh, independently-bounded
     `:http/post` call of its own.
  2. **A best-effort private/loopback/link-local/multicast destination-IP
     block runs before every hop's actual connection**
     (`InetAddress/getAllByName` -> reject if ANY resolved address is
     loopback, link-local, RFC1918/site-local, IPv6 unique-local
     (`fc00::/7`), multicast, or any-local/wildcard). This is explicitly NOT
     a complete DNS-rebinding defense -- see `destination-blocked?` and
     docs/adr/0066 'Remaining gaps': the address checked here is not pinned
     for the actual `HttpClient.send` connection that follows, so a TOCTOU
     race against attacker-controlled DNS with a very short TTL is not fully
     closed by this check alone.
  3. **The response body is read through a length-bounded stream reader**
     (never `BodyHandlers/ofByteArray`'s fully-unbounded in-memory buffer),
     and every response header is folded to a bounded count/size before
     being handed back to `http.cljc`. Both defend `http.cljc`'s own
     post-transport checks (`value/bounded-string!` on the body,
     `typed-headers` on the header set) -- which run OUTSIDE
     `invoke-transport`'s try/catch -- from throwing an unhandled exception
     on an ordinary large-body or many-header real-world response, which
     would otherwise violate ADR 0026's own invariant that 'the guest never
     receives a connection, stream, promise, or host exception'.

  ## `:cljs` / nbb production transport (ADR 0117)

  nbb/Node has no built-in *synchronous* HTTP primitive (`fetch` is
  Promise-based). This namespace keeps the reference provider's synchronous
  `(fn [request] -> reply)` contract by running each hop in a child
  `node` process via `child_process.spawnSync` (the same blocking-subprocess
  pattern this monorepo already uses for conformance launchers). The
  redirect loop, allow-list revalidation, and connect-refusal asymmetry
  stay in portable cljs so they match the `:clj` loop's structure and
  remain unit-testable with `with-redefs`. Destination-IP blocking on
  `:cljs` resolves hostnames through the same child (`dns.lookup`); IP
  literals are checked without DNS. DNS-rebinding TOCTOU remains an
  explicit remaining gap (same honesty as ADR 0066's `:clj` path)."
