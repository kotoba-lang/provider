(ns provider.http-ingress-transport
  "Production **ingress** transport for the bounded HTTP ingress capability
  kit (`provider.http-ingress`, W5 family-3), backed by a real `node:http`
  server on `:cljs`.

  This is the ingress-side sibling of `provider.http-transport` (ADR 0066 /
  ADR 0117), which is the *egress* transport for `provider.http`. Read that
  namespace first: the shape of the problem and the house limits are the
  same, only the direction is reversed.

      provider.http.cljc            bounded egress capability   (guest calls out)
      provider.http-transport.cljc  java.net.http / node child  (ADR 0066/0117)

      provider.http-ingress.cljc            bounded ingress capability  (guest is called)
      provider.http-ingress-transport.cljc  node:http server            <- THIS FILE

  ## What was missing

  `http_ingress.cljc` already defines the whole guest-facing contract --
  host-owned queue, accept-then-reply pairing, bounded typed request and
  response, canonical i64 status. What it never had was anything that binds
  it to a socket: `enqueue!` was only ever called by test harnesses. The
  capability was therefore unreachable in production, and hosts that needed
  to serve HTTP kept reaching for an ambient socket instead. This namespace
  is the missing binding, and nothing else.

  ## It does not redesign, fork, or weaken the capability

  This namespace defines **no new capability, no new queue, no new pairing
  rule and no new types**, and it does not modify `http_ingress.cljc`. It
  calls `ingress/create-provider`, uses that kit's own `enqueue!`, and hands
  the guest that kit's own `:invoke` functions -- each *wrapped* by a
  function that delegates first and only then observes the outcome:

  - the accept wrapper calls the real accept, and when (and only when) the
    real accept returns the option's `some` arm, moves the head of this
    namespace's parallel socket FIFO into the in-flight slot;
  - the reply wrapper calls the real reply -- so every bound in
    `http_ingress.cljc` (status range, header count/uniqueness/size, body
    size, `reply requires a prior accept`) runs first and throws first --
    and writes to the socket only if the real reply returned `true`.

  The two FIFOs stay in lockstep because they are only ever appended to and
  popped from by the same two operations. A host that calls the kit's
  `enqueue!` directly (bypassing this listener) is not an error: the accept
  wrapper then finds its own FIFO empty, marks the in-flight slot
  `:detached`, and the matching reply is counted (`:detached-replies`) and
  dropped rather than misrouted onto some other client's socket.

  ## The guest never receives a socket

  Nothing that crosses to the guest is or contains a `net.Socket`, an
  `http.IncomingMessage`, an `http.ServerResponse`, a stream, a promise or a
  host exception. The guest sees exactly the two bounded typed values
  `http_ingress.cljc` defines: `[:option incoming-request]` out of accept,
  and a `:bool` out of reply. Socket handles live only in this namespace's
  own state atom, keyed by position in the FIFO.

  ## Bounds are enforced at the host, before the queue

  A request that violates a bound is answered by the *host* with a proper
  HTTP status and never enters the queue, so an over-limit request cannot
  consume queue depth or reach the guest at all:

      request target over `:max-path-bytes` (4096)        -> 414
      more than `:max-headers` (32) headers               -> 431
      header name over 512 B / value over 65536 B         -> 431
      header name outside the RFC 9110 token charset      -> 431
      declared or streamed body over `:max-body-bytes`    -> 413
      queue already at `:max-queue-depth` (8)             -> 503
      any other host-side rejection from `enqueue!`       -> 400
      guest did not reply within `:reply-timeout-ms`      -> 504
      listener stopped with the request outstanding       -> 503

  The value bounds are `http_ingress.cljc`'s own constants
  (`max-path-bytes`, `max-headers`, `max-body-bytes`, and
  `kotoba.kir.value`'s keyword/string byte limits, which are what its
  `validate-headers!` checks against), not a second set invented here; the
  restricted response-header set mirrors
  `http-transport/restricted-header-names` for the same reason it exists
  there -- framing belongs to the host, not to the peer that supplied the
  headers.

  ## Backpressure is explicit, never silent

  When the host-owned queue is already at `:max-queue-depth`, the request is
  **not** enqueued, **not** dropped silently, and **not** buffered somewhere
  else: the host answers `503 Service Unavailable` with `Retry-After: 0` and
  ends the response. That is the only backpressure signal, and it is visible
  both to the HTTP client (as a status) and to the operator (as the
  `:queue-full` counter in `snapshot`). `:max-queue-depth` is passed
  straight through to `ingress/create-provider`, so the depth the client is
  bounded by and the depth the guest sees are the same number.

  A request that is enqueued but never accepted, or accepted but never
  replied to, would otherwise hold its socket forever. `:reply-timeout-ms`
  (default 30000, matching `http/max-timeout-ms` on the egress side) bounds
  that: the host answers 504 and marks the entry answered. The entry is
  deliberately left in the queue as a tombstone -- removing it would mean
  reaching into the kit's queue, which is exactly the fork this namespace
  refuses -- so the guest can still accept and reply to it later; that late
  reply is counted (`:dropped-replies`) and discarded instead of being
  written onto a socket that already carries a 504.

  ## Status is canonical i64

  `http.cljc`'s docstring explains why: on `:cljs` a plain number fails
  `typed-cap-call` result validation and makes range checks unreliable when
  mixed with bigint, so the canonical representation of an `:i64` field is a
  JS `bigint`. The status the guest supplies to `:http/reply` is therefore a
  bigint; `http_ingress.cljc` has already range-checked it into [100, 599]
  by the time this namespace sees it, and `js/Number` on a bigint in that
  range is exact.

  ## `:cljs` only

  The socket half of this file is `#?(:cljs ...)` on purpose. There is no
  JVM listener here and no third-party dependency anywhere: this repository
  has none, deliberately. The classification and canonicalization helpers
  above the socket section are portable `.cljc` so they can be reasoned
  about, and tested, without binding a port."
