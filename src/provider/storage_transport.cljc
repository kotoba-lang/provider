(ns provider.storage-transport
  "Production transport for the bounded storage capability kit (ADR 0028,
  `provider.storage`), backed by a real blocking
  `java.net.http.HttpClient` call to a host-configured durable key/value
  service. See docs/adr/0071-production-storage-transport-host-configured-kv-endpoint.md
  for the full design rationale; this docstring is the summary.

  This namespace does NOT define a new provider or a new capability, and does
  NOT modify `storage.cljc`. Every bound `storage.cljc` already enforces --
  bounded keys, bounded 65536-byte values, `:option i64` conditional versions
  validated before the transport is ever called, backend exceptions redacted
  to a generic typed error -- runs exactly as before, unchanged and
  un-weakened. This namespace builds the one thing every provider in this ADR
  chain has always deferred to the host (ADR 0028: 'The injected transport
  owns durability, quota enforcement, and atomic version checks'): a real
  synchronous `(fn [request] -> reply)` you pass as `:transport` to
  `provider.storage/provider`.

  ## Storage must not acquire ambient filesystem authority (ADR 0049,
  `resources/kotoba/lang/capability-kits/storage-v1.edn`'s own
  `:ambient-filesystem false`)

  Unlike a naive implementation that would reach for `java.io.File`/
  `clojure.java.io` and write bytes under some default location (e.g. the
  process's home directory), this namespace never touches the local
  filesystem at all. It follows the exact same 'host injects a real
  synchronous transport, this namespace never invents an ambient default'
  pattern ADR 0064 (LLM) and ADR 0066 (HTTP) already established: durability
  is delegated ENTIRELY to a durable key/value HTTP service the host
  operates and explicitly points this transport at via a REQUIRED `:endpoint`
  construction option (or the `KOTOBA_STORAGE_ENDPOINT` env var) -- there is
  no default endpoint baked in (unlike LLM's `murakumo-main`), because unlike
  LLM there is no repo-wide well-known storage backend to default to; forcing
  explicit host configuration is itself part of the 'no ambient authority'
  design, not an oversight.

  ## Wire shape -- a single fixed JSON-over-HTTPS operation, not a
  filesystem-shaped path per key

  A single fixed path (default `/storage/v1/transact`, overridable) is POSTed
  to for every operation; the operation, namespace, key, value, and
  conditional version all travel in a JSON request body, never in the URL
  path. This is a deliberate simplification versus (for example) encoding the
  key into a URL path segment: keys are guest-controlled bounded strings, and
  folding them into a path invites a whole class of percent-encoding/path-
  traversal edge cases (`../`, encoded slashes, etc.) that a fixed-path
  JSON-body design sidesteps entirely -- there is no path segment ever built
  from guest-controlled bytes.

  ## No guest-facing SSRF surface, unlike ADR 0066's HTTP transport

  `:storage/transact` has no guest-supplied destination at all --
  `storage-namespace` is fixed once per provider instance by the HOST at
  construction (`storage.cljc`'s own docstring: 'The namespace is host-owned
  and never supplied by guest code'), and this transport's own `:endpoint` is
  likewise fixed once by the host at construction. This makes storage's
  threat model like ADR 0064's LLM transport (one fixed, host-chosen
  destination) rather than ADR 0066's HTTP transport (an arbitrary
  guest-named destination bounded only by an allow-list) -- so this
  namespace has no redirect-revalidation loop, no destination-IP block, and
  no allow-list: there is exactly one destination, chosen entirely by the
  host, never by the guest.

  ## Fail-closed sanitization of the upstream reply

  `storage.cljc`'s own post-transport checks (`entry`'s `value/bounded-string!`
  on the value, `valid-version?` on the version) run OUTSIDE
  `invoke-transport`'s try/catch, exactly like `http.cljc`'s post-transport
  header/body checks (ADR 0066 point 3). An oversized value or an
  out-of-range/non-integer version in the upstream JSON response would
  otherwise throw an unhandled exception past that boundary. This namespace
  defends against that by truncating an oversized value to
  `storage/max-value-bytes` and, more conservatively, by turning an invalid
  version or current-version into an explicit non-retryable
  `:storage/invalid-response` typed error rather than fabricating a
  plausible-looking version number -- a wrong-but-plausible version could
  silently mask a real conditional-version conflict, which is a strictly
  worse failure mode than a typed, visible error.

  JVM only (`:clj`) for now, for the same reason as ADR 0064's LLM transport
  and ADR 0066's HTTP transport: `java.net.http.HttpClient.send` is
  genuinely blocking, matching every reference provider's synchronous
  transport contract in this repo (`kotoba.compiler.reference-runtime` has no
  promise/callback machinery for a provider to return through); nbb/cljs has
  no built-in synchronous HTTP primitive. The `:cljs` branch below throws a
  clearly-labeled 'not yet implemented' instead of silently pretending to
  support it."
